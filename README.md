# Sales-Insights
I have created a Power BI report by analysing the sales data of AtliQ hardware which can help them better to understand and grow their sales.
Steps I have done to create this report.
--> Created this report by downloading the csv data to MySQL and transformed into tabular form.
--> Uploaded the data to Power BI and transformed some data, types and some of columns in the data. 
--> Visualized the data in the PowerBI for analysis.
